	description:
		`Technology has always been more than a career—it's my passion. From a young age, I’ve been driven by curiosity to understand how things work, constantly exploring ways to innovate and improve. 
		As a self-taught developer, I’ve built a strong foundation in full-stack development while diving deep into emerging fields like blockchain, cybersecurity, and machine learning. 
		My homelab serves as both a playground for experimentation and a testament to my dedication to hands-on learning.
		When I'm not solving complex problems or building solutions, I enjoy gaming or refining my technical skills.`,
